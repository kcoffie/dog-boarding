# Dog Boarding App — Session Handoff (v2.4)
**Last updated:** March 1, 2026
**Status:** v2.4 — REQ-400 and REQ-401 complete. Two print bugs fixed (`bb4e244`, `dbd4d7f`). **Migration 014 must be applied in Supabase before pushing to Vercel.**

---

## Current State

- **651 tests, 650 pass.** 1 failure is pre-existing DST-flaky test in `DateNavigator.test.jsx` — unrelated.
- **Last committed (not yet deployed):** `dbd4d7f` — fix: increase print font sizes for legibility (#400)
- **Commits not yet deployed:** `0dd862f`, `bb4e244`, `dbd4d7f`
- **Currently deployed:** `4061fa4`, `8598a59`, `713a722`, `bf01842`, `ebcb00f`, `927b30e`
- Migrations 012 and 013 applied in production. **Migration 014 is pending** — apply before next deploy.
- 3 crons live: cron-auth 0:00 UTC → cron-schedule 0:05 UTC → cron-detail 0:10 UTC
- Vercel env vars confirmed set: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, VITE_EXTERNAL_SITE_USERNAME, VITE_EXTERNAL_SITE_PASSWORD

> **Check first thing each session:** Did overnight crons run?
> After migration 014 is applied: `SELECT cron_name, last_ran_at, status, result FROM cron_health ORDER BY cron_name;`
> Or check the Cron Health card on the Settings page.
> (Pre-014 fallback: Vercel dashboard → Logs → filter by `/api/cron-*` — logs expire in ~1h)

## Deploy Checklist (next deploy)

1. **Apply migration 014 in Supabase** — `supabase/migrations/014_add_cron_health.sql`
   - Creates `cron_health` table with RLS (authenticated read, service role write)
   - Run in Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor, or via `supabase db push`
2. **Push to Vercel** — `git push origin main` (will deploy `0dd862f`, `bb4e244`, `dbd4d7f`)
3. **Verify** — after next midnight cron run, check Settings page → Cron Health card
4. **Verify print** — Calendar → Print → Generate & Print should show content (not blank)

## v2.4 What Was Built

### REQ-401: Cron Health Monitoring ✅
- `supabase/migrations/014_add_cron_health.sql` — `cron_health` table (cron_name UNIQUE, last_ran_at, status, result JSONB, error_msg)
- `api/_cronHealth.js` — shared `writeCronHealth(supabase, name, status, result, errorMsg)` helper (underscore prefix = not a Vercel route)
- All 3 cron handlers upsert on every exit path: success, skip (no_session), session_cleared, failure
- `src/hooks/useCronHealth.js` — reads `cron_health` table for the Settings page
- `SettingsPage.jsx` — new "Cron Health" card above Sync Settings; shows Auth / Schedule / Detail rows with last ran time (relative, absolute on hover), OK/Failed badge, result summary
- Tests: `src/__tests__/scraper/cronHealth.test.js` (4 tests — writeCronHealth behavior)

### REQ-400: Calendar Print / Export ✅
- Print button top-right of Calendar page header → `PrintModal` with date range pickers (default: current month)
- "Generate & Print" → `handlePrint(from, to)` → sets `printRange` state → `useEffect` fires after render → `window.print()`
- `PrintView` portaled to `document.body` (via `createPortal`) — this is critical so `@media print` CSS can hide `#root` and show `#calendar-print-view` correctly
- Each day section: date header, Arriving (green) / Staying (blue) / Departing (amber) groups, overnight count + Gross + Net summary
- Empty days skipped; all app chrome hidden during print
- Print font sizes: date header 22px, section labels 15px, booking rows 17px, summary 15px
- Tests: `src/__tests__/pages/CalendarPrint.test.js` (4 tests — eachDayInRange logic)
- **Bug fixes (`bb4e244`, `dbd4d7f`):** original used `setTimeout(print, 50)` (race) and rendered PrintView inside #root (CSS cascade — blank page). Fixed with portal + useEffect.

### REQ-402: Code Review & Hardening ⏭️
- Deferred — single-tenant confirmed, scope defined in separate session

---

## v2.3 Outcome (for reference)

- **REQ-300 ✅** — Supabase dashboard config complete (manual)
- **REQ-301 ✅** — Change Password card added to Settings page
- **REQ-302 ✅** — `cleanText()` decodes `&#x27;`/`&apos;`; SQL backfill run (fixes Lilly O'Brien)
- **REQ-303 ✅** — Revenue table columns sortable (Dog, Check-in, Check-out, Revenue); default: Check-out desc
- **REQ-304 ✅** — Dogs page cleaned up: removed CSV import, Add Boarding buttons, Edit/Delete row buttons
- **REQ-305 ✅** — Mochi Hill Jan 23–26 data verified present
- **REQ-306 ✅** — Sync now skips archived appointments; Millie McSpadden C63QgH5K boarding deleted + won't recur

---

## Known Data Issues

1. **Millie McSpadden — C63QgH5K boarding deleted, sync_appointment archived:**
   - C63QgNHs (Mar 4–19, `billed_amount=1025`, `day_rate=50`) is the active record.
   - C63QgH5K sync_appointment is `archived`; sync will now skip it permanently.
   - Monitor: if a third boarding appears for Millie in March, investigate.

2. **Null service_types** (self-correct on next sync of their date range):
   C63QgKsL, C63QfyoF, C63QgNGU, C63QgP2y, C63QgOHe

3. **Amended appointments not yet archived:**
   - C63QgNGU→C63QfyoF (4/1–13): old URL likely inaccessible — reconciliation should catch it on next sync

---

## Remaining Backlog

- REQ-107: Sync history UI + enable/disable toggle
- Fix status field extraction (always null — `.appt-change-status` needs `textContent` on `<a><i>`)
- Fix or remove DST-flaky test in `DateNavigator.test.jsx` (pre-existing, 1 test fails on DST boundary days)
- `est.` label in Revenue table is intentional — shown when `billed_amount IS NULL`, uses `night_rate × nights`
- REQ-402: Code review / hardening (deferred, single-tenant)
- v3: new data capture + new page + email image report (planning session pending)

---

## Decisions Locked In

- **Rate fallback chain:** `boarding.night_rate ?? dog.night_rate ?? 0`
- **Single-line pricing:** classified as night or day based on service name
- **Two-line pricing:** night from non-day line, day from day line
- **Day service patterns:** `SCRAPER_CONFIG.dayServicePatterns` = `/day/i, /daycare/i, /^DC/i, /pack/i`
- **Pricing filter (sync.js):** all-day-services OR staff-boarding → skip before saving
- **Dog rate updates:** only when `updateRates && rate > 0` (never zero-overwrite)
- **HASH_FIELDS:** identity/structure fields only — pricing fields NOT included (intentional)
- **Unchanged path:** explicitly writes `appointment_total` + `pricing_line_items` when present
- **Multi-pet:** `all_pet_names[]` from extraction; secondary external_id = `{appt_id}_p{index}`
- **REQ-110 parse degradation:** does NOT flag missing `appointment_total` (legitimately absent)
- **sync_status column:** use `sync_status = 'archived'` — `is_archived` does not exist
- **Archived appointments:** preloaded into `archivedExternalIds` Set at sync start; skipped before detail fetch

## Useful SQL

```sql
-- Check cron health (after migration 014)
SELECT cron_name, last_ran_at, status, result, error_msg FROM cron_health ORDER BY cron_name;

-- Check data quality
SELECT b.external_id, d.name, b.night_rate, b.billed_amount
FROM boardings b JOIN dogs d ON b.dog_id = d.id
WHERE b.night_rate IS NULL AND b.billed_amount > 0
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Full rate picture
SELECT b.billed_amount, b.night_rate, b.day_rate, d.name,
       b.arrival_datetime, b.departure_datetime
FROM boardings b JOIN dogs d ON b.dog_id = d.id
WHERE b.billed_amount IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY b.departure_datetime DESC;

-- If sync gets stuck
UPDATE sync_logs SET status = 'failed', completed_at = NOW()
WHERE status = 'running' AND started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';

-- Archive a stale sync_appointment manually
UPDATE sync_appointments
SET sync_status = 'archived', last_change_type = 'archived', last_changed_at = NOW()
WHERE external_id = 'REPLACE_ME';

-- Null the boarding FK before deleting (avoids FK violation)
UPDATE sync_appointments SET mapped_boarding_id = NULL
WHERE mapped_boarding_id = (SELECT id FROM boardings WHERE external_id = 'REPLACE_ME');
DELETE FROM boardings WHERE external_id = 'REPLACE_ME';
```
