- **1065 tests, 61 files, 0 failures**
- **main clean** — PR #208 (U-2) + PR #209 (C-1) both merged today
- Live at [qboarding.vercel.app](https://qboarding.vercel.app)

### Session 32 Summary (this session)
| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| U-2 — "Send a Question" button in nav user dropdown | ✅ Done. PR #208 merged. `api/send-question.js` + `QuestionModal` in `Layout.jsx`. 7 tests (REQ-700). WhatsApp to Kate via `getAlertRecipients()`. |
| OVERVIEW.md corrections — Vercel cron times were wrong | ✅ Done. Fixed all cron times (midnight UTC = 5 PM PDT, not midnight PDT). Added "When Does the DB Get Updated From AGYD?" section. Updated "A Real Weekday" timeline. Removed stale Claude vision reference. |
| C-1 — Employee overnight calendar grid | ✅ Done. PR #209 merged. Second calendar grid below dog calendar on CalendarPage. Colored name chips, N/A pill, blank for unassigned. 7 tests (REQ-701). Vercel deploy pending verification. |

### Session 31 Summary (reference)
| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Integration check alert — "Missing from DB: Rio Prabhakar 6/15-7/3 (C63Qglz7)" | ✅ Diagnosed. Bad booking in AGYD — same-day filter correctly skipped it. Kate confirmed bad entry; B-3 will re-queue on URL timestamp change. No code change needed. |
| Integration check WINDOW_DAYS=7 too narrow for far-future boardings | ⏸ Deferred. Fix: `WINDOW_DAYS = 7 → 90` in `scripts/integration-check.js`. Kate monitoring. |
| "Day boarding {date}" label rename — EmployeeDropdown checkbox | ✅ Done. PR #206 merged. |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Verify Vercel deploy** — go to [qboarding.vercel.app](https://qboarding.vercel.app) → Calendar page → confirm "Overnight Staff" grid renders below the dog calendar with colored name chips and N/A pills
2. **Kate picks G-1 or G-3** — see specs in SPRINT_PLAN.md

## Upcoming Tickets

| # | Ticket | Complexity | Notes |
|---|--------|------------|-------|
| G-1 | Alert on failed wamid — `message_delivery_status` table exists but nothing fires on `status='failed'` | Medium | Kate to pick this or G-3 |
| G-3 | Client-facing status page — last cron run, last notify sent, last delivery status | Medium | Kate to pick this or G-1 |
| B-4 | Integration check WINDOW_DAYS too narrow — change `WINDOW_DAYS = 7 → 90` in `scripts/integration-check.js` | Trivial | Deferred — do if repeated false alerts on far-future bookings |

## Key Facts (Don't Re-Derive)

- **VITE_SYNC_PROXY_TOKEN**: used for `Authorization: Bearer` auth on internal API endpoints (`/api/send-question`, `/api/run-sync`, etc.)
- **getAlertRecipients()**: returns `INTEGRATION_CHECK_RECIPIENTS` (Kate only — `+18312477375`). NOT `NOTIFY_RECIPIENTS` (full team).
- **nightAssignments** in DataContext: `[{ date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', employeeId, workedFollowingDay }]` — top-level in `useData()`
- **employees** in DataContext: lives at `settings.employees`, NOT top-level
- **Vercel cron times**: all run at midnight UTC = 5:00 PM PDT (documented correctly in OVERVIEW.md as of this session)
- **K-8 open**: Replace Meta test phone number before ~July 2, 2026
