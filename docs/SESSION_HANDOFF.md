# Dog Boarding App — Session Handoff (v6 — UAT restart)
**Last updated:** October 22, 2026, ~22:10 UTC (session 44, end). **Production = main (`6ff56de`, #335), unchanged this session.** The roster reaches Kate on **Telegram**; she forwards the image to Charlie by hand. **Session 44 was planning only: the full TBD triage is on GitHub (labels + comments) and the new `docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md` (v7, approved) is the plan. Next: check Fri 10-23's on-time 4am roster, then Sprint 1's top 3, starting with #321 (deadline 10-30).**

**The goal:** UAT with Charlie and her admin in November (on today's sync), then the app in use in her business, then the project as a portfolio piece (#338). The plan, milestones and dates: **`docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md`**. Do what's needed, simply; nothing more.

---

## ▶ START HERE (every session)

1. **Read this file to the end, then `docs/ENGINEERING_PROCESS.md`** (team gates) **and `docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md`** (the plan; start each session by naming its top 3). Check the baseline before changing anything: `git status`, `npm run test:run`, open PRs and issues.
2. **Kate's rules:**
   - Work on branches and never commit to `main`. Commit and push each green chunk. Claude may open and squash-merge PRs once every check is green **and** the reviewer agent has run.
   - Use `type: description (#issue)` commits. Never add AI attribution: no Co-Authored-By, no Claude-Session, no session links, no "Generated with Claude Code" in PR bodies. A PreToolUse hook, the commit hook and CI reject them, and they overrule Claude Code's per-session reminder.
   - Tests must catch bugs, not just exist. Follow the good-tests rules and report the mutation score, not just "N tests pass".
   - Give options as one line each with real counts, then one recommendation.
   - Ask before sending any message to anyone (Telegram test alerts, SMS, WhatsApp), re-enabling workflows, adding secrets or changing repo settings.
   - Messages must never be tied to the client's (Charlie's) business. The app is Kate's alone, and Kate has no registered business.
3. **After every merge:** `npm run check:deploy` (REQ-654). It reads main's head from GitHub, waits for qboard's Vercel status, then checks the home page and roster image. Only `main` (and `preview/**` branches) deploy on Vercel (#298).
4. **Shell:** `gh` is aliased to `history | grep`, so always type `command gh …`. Production is **`https://qboarding.vercel.app`** (Vercel project `qboard`; the duplicate `dog-boarding` Vercel project was **disconnected from GitHub by Kate on 2026-10-19** and no longer deploys; since then qboard's commit status is named plain `Vercel`). Claude can't read Vercel env or logs (no CLI; Hobby logs keep 1 h). Use Kate's Chrome, the Supabase tables, or ask Kate.
5. **Gates:** run the `architect` agent on the design note before a new job, service, secret or table. Run the `reviewer` agent before every PR. A new scheduled job ships with its failure alert, and that alert must run outside the job's own scheduler.
6. **New code only:** the gates cover code written from 2026-10-16 on. Bringing older code up to the same bar is #239.
7. **Things Claude can't do here; ask Kate to run them with `! <command>`:**
   - Delete files: a hook blocks `git rm`/`rm` in this repo.
   - Dispatch a workflow that sends a message (e.g. `notify-4am.yml`), and push to a Dependabot branch: the permission classifier blocks both even with Kate's OK in chat.
   - Read Vercel env or logs.

## Current State (2026-10-22 ~22:10 UTC, end of session 44)

### Session 44: what happened (no code changed)
1. **The 4am check was deferred:** the first on-time run is Fri 10-23, after this session. It's step 2 below.
2. **One TBD list, from every source** (issues, PRs, this file, UAT plan, the May sprint plan, REQUIREMENTS, design notes, job docs, code TODOs, memory), triaged with Kate:
   - **Priorities are GitHub labels:** `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`, `to-investigate` (created this session). Every triaged issue has a **"Triage 2026-10-22"** comment with Kate's note and the answer to her question. Read those before re-deriving anything: `command gh issue list --label "priority: high"`.
   - **Closed:** #246 (fixed in c8b5c72), #238 (done in #240/#283; vitest 5 stays as PR #285), #145 (eslint 10 done; plugin-react 6 is #284), #293 (superseded by #324), #10 (hooks enforce it), #257 (folded into #321).
   - **Filed:** #337 (clean-up of unused secrets, env vars, the duplicate Vercel project; Kate, high) and **#338 portfolio** (high, public; names Claude Code openly, which Kate OK'd for that issue only).
3. **New `docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md` (v7), approved by Kate.** The May plan is archived at `docs/archive/SPRINT_PLAN-2026-05.md`. Four 2-week sprints with a top 3 each, milestones M1 UAT-ready (11-13), M2 in use (January), M3 #318 done (~12-09), M4 portfolio (end of December), and an investigation queue.
4. **Kate's decisions (2026-10-22):**
   - **Start UAT now on today's sync; build #318 alongside it.** #318 is **done at build step 6** (retire old paths). Steps 7 (#317/#311) and 8 (#313) are separate work after M3.
   - **The engine (#318 step 3) moves up to Sprint 2.** A Sync Now break during UAT is an accepted risk.
   - **Clear (#324): only Kate may press it now; later, only admins.** Today any signed-in user can (`api/site-access.js` checks sign-in only).
   - **DST must not need code edits:** 7am, 8:30am and Friday pm move to the Vercel Pacific-hour pattern of REQ-658 (#321). If not merged by **Fri 10-30**, hand-edit the GitHub crons for PST (table in `docs/job_docs/notify-jobs.md` "DST Note"). Never move `notify-4am.yml` off 14:00 UTC.
   - **Telegram won't work for Charlie.** Kate forwards the roster image by hand until #260 finds a real channel.
   - **#8 (calendar look):** Kate does it herself with a browser agent.
   - **#13** now carries the UAT plan plus a step-by-step script for Charlie, which Claude dry-runs on production first.
   - **ADRs:** Kate wants them. 004–007 are planned (sync redesign superseding 002, breaker + single login, roster claim row, Telegram alerts), and every architect-gated decision gets one from now on.
   - Commits and PRs still carry no AI attribution.
5. **Found:** the 10-22 Integration Check alert "Missing from DB" for C63QhL5g and C63QhLI1 (title "10/19-22") was a false positive. Both are 6-hour day visits the sync correctly skipped (`sync_queue.meta.detail_skip = same_day`); the check reads only the title. That's #315 recurring, now high priority.
6. **Docs fixed:** REQ-652 status → Complete; the job docs' G-1 WhatsApp delivery-alert backlog item and the already-done `window` rename removed.
7. **Two TechPM role files** in the repo root (`TechPM.md` untracked, `TechPM_1.md` tracked): Kate wants that role (2-week sprints, the top 3 tickets each session, hardening before features, ADR reminders, challenge low-value effort).

### Session 43 (reference): what happened
1. **First-day checks on #324 A+B: all clean.** No cron ran between 04:07 and 17:00 UTC (expected). `site_access` never tripped (session good to 10-23 06:37 UTC). Integration Check's 08:00 run started at 13:18 UTC (5 h late) and was green. ops-watch 10-22 17:36: only the two expected queue findings (**55 pending, up from 45**; Kate: leave the limit). No browser Sync Now since PR B, so the Edge 302 is still unproven; Kate needn't press it just for that (the check only fires when a booking has vanished).
2. **PR #333 merged (06acd40):** `sessionCache.js` and its test deleted; **migration 029** dropped `sync_settings.session_cookies` / `session_expires_at`. **Kate ran the SQL** ~15:50 UTC; verified gone, `site_access` intact. Reviewer: no blockers; stale docs fixed.
3. **The 4am roster arrived at 8:48 PDT** (GitHub started it 4 h 48 m late). Kate's manual `gh workflow run` created no run.
4. **Roster trigger, option A (4am only), Kate 2026-10-22.** Design note PR #334 (architect: proceed with changes, all folded in). Kate approved: fallback cron 11:00 → 14:00 UTC; a `force` checkbox for manual re-sends.
5. **PR #335 merged (6ff56de, ~17:40 UTC), REQ-658, `check:deploy` OK.** How it works:
   - Vercel crons call `/api/notify` at 11:00 and 12:00 UTC. `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` = the on-time trigger (fails closed; 4am only). It sends only 04:00–05:59 Pacific, Mon–Fri, so **DST needs no edit for the 4am roster**.
   - Every automatic 4am call claims the Pacific day on the `cron_health` row **`notify-4am-claim`** (one conditional update) before any work. "Already sent" needs `notify.lastDate` = today **and** `sentAt` on today's Pacific date.
   - **GitHub `notify-4am.yml` is now the fallback at `0 14 * * 1-5`** (weekdays, from 06:00 Pacific). It sends only if the on-time send didn't, and then alerts Kate why (job **`notify-4am-alert`**, in ops-watch's `ALERT_JOBS`). Manual run: tick **force**.
   - No roster data at 4am now alerts Kate (once a day). A `notify` failure no longer wipes the 7am baseline (`writeCronHealth(..., { keepResult: true })`).
   - The trigger fetches the roster image from `https://qboarding.vercel.app` (`PROD_URL`).
   - Evidence: every DB behaviour checked on production with a throwaway row (deleted); 3 concurrent claims → exactly 1 won. Suite 1935 passed / 1 skipped. **Scoped Stryker (TZ=UTC): changed lines 93.5%**, `rosterTrigger.js` 93.37%, `notify.js` 85.77%. Reviewer ran twice (1 must-fix found and fixed: a `date=` preview would have blocked the next 4am).
   - **Known and accepted:** 7am and the fallback both run at 14:00 UTC, so on a failure day both may send.
   - Runbook: "I didn't get the roster this morning" → "How the 4am roster is sent". Design: `docs/specs/roster-trigger-design-note.md`.
6. **Not verified yet:** the live trigger (no `CRON_SECRET` locally; it's only in Vercel). Its first run is Fri 10-23.
7. **Don't run `notify-4am` without force on 10-22:** today's roster went out before the claim row existed, so an unforced run sends a false "didn't go out on time" alert.
8. **Tool notes:** the classifier blocked `gh pr merge` for #333 ("Merge Without Review") but allowed #334/#335 once Kate said to merge. macOS has no `timeout` command.

### Sessions 41–42 (reference)
#322 merged (PR #327). #324 plan (PR #328), PR A (#329, paced fetch, stop on 429/403, reconcile only on a 302 to `/schedule`), PR B (#331, `site_access` table + breaker + Clear on Settings, one login via `loginToSite`, migration 028). First night on A+B (10-22) clean: `auth` `refreshed`, breaker never tripped. Details: git history of this file.

## Current reference (still true after session 44)

### Telegram alerts (#265, live, proven 2026-10-19)
- **The bot is `@qap_alert_bot`** (neutral name, Kate's).
- **`sendAlert()` / `alertAndLog()` in `src/lib/alertKate.js`:**
  - One attempt, 15 s timeout. It never throws, and no error or log line contains the token.
  - Every attempt is written to `message_log`.
- **A failed alert is never silent:**
  - cron-health-check, integration-check and gmail-monitor **exit 1** (red run → GitHub emails Kate).
  - gmail-monitor marks an email processed only after delivery, and its search excludes its own failure emails.
  - send-question returns **502** instead of "Sent!".
  - ops-watch reports failed alert rows from the last 24 h.
- **Kate's decisions:**
  - Client data in alert text going to Telegram is OK.
  - An hourly red gmail-monitor while Telegram is down is OK.
  - The roster comes to Kate on Telegram until Twilio (2026-10-19). ops-watch's "no 4am roster" finding now reads Telegram sends.
- **The secrets have existed since 2026-10-19, and both paths are proven** (Session 35 item 7). If they're ever removed, every alert fails as "not configured" and those runs go red, which is loud and intended.

### Kate's setup steps (steps 1–4 done 2026-10-19; kept for reference if the bot or token changes)
1. In @BotFather: `/setjoingroups` → `@qap_alert_bot` → Disable. Then send the bot any message.
2. Chat ID: copy the bot token, then run `! curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot$(pbpaste)/getUpdates" | grep -o '"chat":{"id":[0-9-]*' | head -1`
3. GitHub secrets: `! pbpaste | command gh secret set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN -R kcoffie/dog-boarding`, then the same for `TELEGRAM_ALERT_CHAT_ID`.
4. Vercel **qboard → Production**, type **Secret**: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_ALERT_CHAT_ID`, `CRON_SECRET` (random, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`), `GH_ACTIONS_TOKEN` (fine-grained PAT, this repo only, Actions read and write). Then **redeploy**.
5. ~~Turn off the duplicate `dog-boarding` Vercel project~~: done 2026-10-19, disconnected from GitHub. Delete it later if nothing misses it.
6. Vercel "Needs Attention" on `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `EXTERNAL_SITE_PASSWORD` and the three `META_*` variables: leave them (Kate, 2026-10-19). Delete the `META_*` ones together with the WhatsApp code in #260.

### Mutation
- **CI on main: 52.06%** (e0fe16a, #310, incremental, 2026-10-20); last full run 50.64% (0239e22). **Ratchet 50** (#306). Score log: `docs/ENGINEERING_PROCESS.md`. Incremental cache now seeded; a `package-lock`/`stryker.config` change forces a full run (~55–60 min). Don't merge on top of a Mutation run whose score you need: the next push to main cancels it.
- **Scoped, local, TZ=UTC:** `rosterChannel.js`, `opsWatch.js`, `syncSettingsRow.js`, `deployCheck.js` 100%; `cron-schedule.js` 98.7%; `verifyUser.js` 98.3%; `send-question` 87.8%; `syncRunner.js` 83.6%; `alertKate` 82%; `notify.js` 81.2%; `syncQueue.js` 69.3%; `notify-intraday.js` 66.9%.
- **Never bump vitest to 5** until the Stryker runner ships #6214 (held in Dependabot's `ignore`). Check "tests per mutant" > 0 after any test-runner change.
- **#239 `pictureOfDay.js`** (51.13% in CI): parked by Kate until UAT starts.

### Issues
Priorities and Kate's triage notes are on GitHub (labels `priority: *`, `to-investigate`; "Triage 2026-10-22" comments). The order of work is `docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md`. The January issues still open (#6–#24) are triaged in the first UAT check-in.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Sync:** `git fetch --prune && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`. Read memory, this file, `docs/ENGINEERING_PROCESS.md` and **`docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md`**. Baseline: `git status`, `npm run test:run`, open PRs.
2. **Check the on-time 4am roster** (first run Fri 10-23; on later days the latest weekday; first PST run Mon 11-02, 12:00–13:59 UTC). Read real timestamps (`date -u`):
   - `SELECT status, result, error_msg, updated_at FROM cron_health WHERE cron_name = 'notify-4am-claim';` → `success`, `result.trigger = 'vercel'`, `result.at` between 11:00 and 12:59 UTC (PDT).
   - `message_log`: one `notify-4am` `sent` in that window, and no `notify-4am-alert` row.
   - The 14:00 UTC `notify-4am` run (Actions) logs `already_sent` (`command gh run view <id> --log | grep -i skipped`).
   - Also: overnight crons (`auth` `refreshed`, `schedule`/`detail` success), `site_access.blocked_at` NULL, ops-watch's latest row.
   - Ask Kate when the roster arrived. If anything's off: `docs/RUNBOOK.md` "How the 4am roster is sent". Report in a few lines; fix nothing without asking.
3. **Tell Kate the Sprint 1 top 3** (the TechPM habit), then work them in this order:
   1. **#321 (deadline Fri 10-30):** 7am, 8:30am, Friday pm to the Vercel pattern (REQ-658: two crons for PDT/PST, the code sends only in the right Pacific hour, a claim row, a failure alert; #257 folded in). Write a short addendum to `docs/specs/roster-trigger-design-note.md`, run the architect, then build. Notes: Hobby fires anywhere in the hour (8:30 can land 8:00–8:59); intraday sends nothing while the channel is telegram (leave it, note its DST); count Vercel crons against Hobby's limit. **If it can't merge by 10-30, ask Kate, then hand-edit the GitHub crons for PST.**
   2. **#13 UAT script:** Kate books watch-first (week of 11-09). Write a step-by-step script for Charlie (and her admin) from `docs/UAT_PLAN.md`, including Send a Question and what happens next; dry-run it on production (Kate's Chrome, with her OK).
   3. **#323 private job logs** (#318 step 2): new table, so design note + architect gate; Kate runs the migration. Must merge before #318 step 4.
   - Also in Sprint 1: #324 leftovers (Clear for Kate only; the Sync Now 302 proof when it happens); investigations batch A (`docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md`); if #321 lands early, start #318 step 3 with the parser parity test.
4. **Kate's own Sprint 1 items:** #337 chores, #8 calendar, booking watch-first, forwarding the roster to Charlie.

## Open TODOs
The full, prioritised list is **`docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md`** (sprints, milestones, investigation queue, backlog) and the GitHub labels. Don't keep a second copy here; update the sprint plan and the issues instead.

## Key Facts (Don't Re-Derive)

- **Tokens (since #301, 2026-10-20):** jobs and server endpoints use the server-only `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` (Vercel qboard Production, GitHub secret, `.env.local`; `check:deploy` reads it). Browser calls (`send-question`, `sync-proxy`) need a signed-in Supabase user (REQ-656). `run-sync` and the invite-code sign-up page are gone. The old `VITE_SYNC_PROXY_TOKEN` is deleted (never write its abuse path anywhere public).
- **AGYD schedule link timestamps**: a stay's links all carry its start; a recurring series has one per visit (#278). Week pages are Sunday–Saturday.
- **Alerts to Kate**: `sendAlert()` / `alertAndLog()` in `src/lib/alertKate.js` (Telegram, REQ-652). The team roster uses `NOTIFY_RECIPIENTS` (WhatsApp, moving to SMS in #260).
- **nightAssignments** in DataContext: `[{ date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', employeeId, workedFollowingDay }]` — top-level in `useData()`
- **employees** in DataContext: lives at `settings.employees`, NOT top-level
- **Vercel cron times**: the sync crons run at 00:00–00:15 UTC (5:00–5:15 PM PDT); ops-watch runs at 17:00 UTC
- **K-8 closed by events:** Meta disabled the test WhatsApp account on 2026-10-18. The roster moves to SMS (#260), and Kate's alerts are on Telegram (#265).
